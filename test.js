    Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble
    was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog,
    strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San
    Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow
    metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming
    the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men
    wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong
    muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the
    frost.
    Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge
    Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden
    among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide
    cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached
    by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns
    and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things
    were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great
    stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad
    servants' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long
    grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there
    was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank
    where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in
    the hot afternoon.
    And over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he
    had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other
    dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they
    did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or
    lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of
    Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange
    creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On
    the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least,
    who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the
    windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with
    brooms and mops.
    But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.
    He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's
    sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long
    twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the
